Project Description 
(as per PD form)	This project aims to use statistical and analytical tools to perform Text Analytics on the Market Data, Financial News, General Online News and Social Media feeds from the web to perform the following:

1.	Sentiment mapping for each stock/sector/benchmark
2.	Overall market trends related to News
3.	Real Time News aggregation and clustering for any stock or sector as a whole.
4.	Visualizations and dashboards complimenting the above




PROJECT PLANNING
Business Issue  
-	Business Context
News from various parts of the world has a strong relationship with the market (investor) sentiments as markets react sharply and promptly to the news and the sentiment they carry. Effective models that incorporate news data are required by all investors (be it Fund Houses, Brokers or Investment Managers). It is not limited to the Trading and Portfolio management but also Risk Control. The idea behind News Analytics is to automate Human Thinking and Reasoning to come up with a quantifiable model and enable users with the decisive capability to predict gains or control risk.

-	Area of impact
Online News websites and Social Media carry close to real-time information with them. Along with the televised news, these sources of news carry bit of sentiment trend along with the news content which together influence the overall investor sentiment over a particular stock or sector. This project aims to tap in that hidden sentiment in news through the application of various Data Mining and Sentiment Analysis techniques. 
Gap Analysis 
 

Project Workflow:

Phase 1: Exploratory analysis and data collection
o	Identify the markets / indices and industry / sector and specific securities of interest
o	Identify various sources of financial and generic news. Shortlist a few news channels and social media content to be used in the project like Yahoo News, MSN News, Twitter, etc.
o	Procure the data from the shortlisted sources above.

Phase 2: Data Cleansing and Mining 
o	Cleansing the unstructured data through the application techniques and consolidating all the data into respective buckets depending on security and sector for analysis
o	Application of various text analytics techniques to understand the hidden meaning in the data and calculating a sentiment score using specific custom built-in dictionaries.

Phase 3: Model building and validation
o	Data partitioning into Training and Validation data sets
o	Running Naïve Bayes classifier on the text
o	Building the model
o	Model validation
Deliverables:

Phase 1:
o	Data sourcing scripts in R
o	Data cleansing scripts
o	Documentation of usage
o	Bi-Weekly status report
Phase 2:
o	Cleansing Scripts, Sentiment Analysis scripts
o	Custom data dictionaries built for a few sample securities
o	Documentation
o	Bi-weekly status report
Phase 3:
o	Model script
o	Bi-weekly status report
o	Final project report and presentation
